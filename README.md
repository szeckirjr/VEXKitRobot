# VEXKit Robot

The goal of this project was to design, build, and program a robot using a VEX Robotics Kit provided by the university. The robot would have to navigate within an arena, avoid its walls, and find a beacon emitting infrared light. When the beacon is found, the robot would approach it, connect a cable to it in some way, and then back away without getting the cable tangled.
